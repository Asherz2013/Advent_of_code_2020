# Advent of code 2020
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) is a coding challenge website, for 25 days of Decemeber, you get a challenge each day to try and solve.

For each successful solve you gain a "star".

This can then be gamified by having leaderboards of friends.

There is also a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/), for people to show off their skills.
